I"þ<p>This site aims to organize a list of open source tools that can be used to create computer games. Special focus is given to tools that donâ€™t need coding skills to be used or require coding only to optional and/or advanced functions.</p>

<p>This project was born because Iâ€™m a lecturer and researcher interested in using games as a tool for teaching. While I saw some students develop games for this purpose using RPG Maker, I immediately thought: are there any open source alternatives to do that?</p>
