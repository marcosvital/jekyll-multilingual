<p>This repository aims to organize a list of open source tools that can be used to create computer games. Special focus is given to tools that donâ€™t need coding skills to be used or require coding only to optional and/or advanced functions.</p>

<p>This website is currently maintained both in English and <a href="https://marcosvital.github.io/open-game-tools/bem-vindo.html">Portuguese</a>.</p>

<h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

<p>Iâ€™m interested in using games as a tool for teaching, and while I saw some students develop games for this purpose using RPG Maker, I immediately thought: are there any open source alternatives to do that?</p>
